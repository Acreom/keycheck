# Keycheck.dev

[Keycheck.dev](https://keycheck.dev) is a tool designed to help developers find and match shortcuts for their apps with those of other applications and tools.

## Features

Keycheck.dev offers **three** main features:

### Check key combinations

Enter a key combination on the main page to see if it matches any shortcuts from supported apps.

### Browse shortcuts by app

View a list of all supported apps and their shortcuts on the apps page.

### Search Shortcuts

You can search the shortcuts by name of the app, shortcut description, or the keys they use.

### Future use cases

We plan to add a feature to generate a PDF cheatsheet of shortcuts for any supported tool.
